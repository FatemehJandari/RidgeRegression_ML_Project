Ridge Regression Machine Learning Project

University of Milan

In this project, a custom ridge regression model is developed within a Python programming environment, excluding the use of pre-existing machine learning libraries. 
The model is trained over four distinct approaches to data preparation and feature encoding on the spotify track dataset. 
This report evaluates and compares the performance of the model across these different dataset versions, highlighting the effectiveness of each data encoding method in predicting the popularity of track. 
This approach not only adheres to the assignment's requirements but also provides a nuanced understanding of the impact of data preprocessing and model tuning on machine learning outcomes.
